  Hope things are going well for you. Just a quick heads up â€” it looks like the trial
  for your account, #{@account.name}, is ending, but you're missing a payment method. If you're ready to move
  forward with Keygen, you can add a payment method on your #{link_to "billing dashboard", "https://app.keygen.sh/billing"}.
  If you're undecided, no worries! Let me know if there's any way that I can help.

    Alternatively, you can view and pay your invoice directly by #{link_to "following this link", @invoice.hosted_invoice_url}.
    You can also add a payment method or bank account for handling future invoices.

  Again, please #{link_to "reach out to me directly", "mailto:zeke@keygen.sh"} if
  you have any questions or concerns!
