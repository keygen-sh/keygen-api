  Unfortunately there was an error while processing your payment for this month.
  If you have a second, can you double check that you have provided an up to date
  payment method on #{link_to "your billing dashboard", "https://app.keygen.sh/billing"}?
- if @invoice.present?

    Alternatively, you can view and pay your invoice directly by #{link_to "following this link", @invoice.hosted_invoice_url}.

  Another attempt to process your subscription's renewal will happen within the
  next few days. Let me know if you have any questions!
