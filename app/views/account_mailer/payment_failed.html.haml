  Unfortunately there was an error while processing this month's payment for
  your account, #{@account.name}. If you have a second, can you double check that you've
  provided an up-to-date payment method on #{link_to "your billing dashboard", "https://app.keygen.sh/billing"}?
- if @invoice.present?

    Alternatively, you can view and pay this invoice directly by #{link_to "following this link", @invoice.hosted_invoice_url}.

  Another attempt to process your subscription's renewal may happen within the
  next few days. Let me know if you have any questions!
