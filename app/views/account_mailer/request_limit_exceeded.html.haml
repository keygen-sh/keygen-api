  Iâ€™m reaching out because your Keygen account has exceeded your tier's daily request limit of
  #{number_with_delimiter @report.request_limit} API requests per-day. Over the past 24 hours,
  #{number_with_delimiter @report.request_count} API requests were made to your Keygen account.
  If you foresee this trend continuing, I recommend that you upgrade from "#{@plan.name}"
  to the next available tier. You can upgrade your account here: #{link_to 'https://app.keygen.sh/subscription', 'https://app.keygen.sh/subscription'}.
  If this request count seems off or unexpected, please ensure that your software is working
  as intended and is not making superfluous API requests.
%p
  Here are a few tips that may help:
%ul
  %li Reduce the number of API requests by #{link_to 'caching validation requests', 'https://github.com/keygen-sh/example-validation-caching'} locally, when possible.
  %li If you're currently running #{link_to 'automated CI/CD tests', 'https://keygen.sh/docs/api/#testing'} against our API, mock our API instead.
  %li Lower the frequency at which you revalidate licenses, when possible.
  %li Talk to us about a separate sandbox account, for development purposes.
%p
  If we see this usage trend continue over the next few weeks, we will automatically upgrade your
  account to the next appropriate tier.

  Let me know if you have any questions about this!
