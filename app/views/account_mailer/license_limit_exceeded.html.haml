  I'm reaching out because your Keygen account #{@account.name} has exceeded your tier's active
  licensed user limit of #{number_with_delimiter @report.license_limit}. Your account currently
  has #{number_with_delimiter @report.license_count} active licensed users. An "active licensed user"
  is any license that has had activity within the last 90 days.

  - if @plan.paid?
    %strong We have not limited your account in any way â€” license creation is still active.
    If you foresee this growth continuing, I recommend that you upgrade from #{@plan.name}
    to the next appropriate tier. You can upgrade here: #{link_to 'https://app.keygen.sh/subscription', 'https://app.keygen.sh/subscription'}.
  - else
    %strong Because you're on a free tier, license creation has been paused.
    I recommend that you upgrade from #{@plan.name} to a paid tier. You can upgrade here: #{link_to 'https://app.keygen.sh/subscription', 'https://app.keygen.sh/subscription'}.

  You can view your account's access logs here: #{link_to 'https://app.keygen.sh/request-logs', 'https://app.keygen.sh/request-logs'}.

  Let me know if you have any questions about this! (You can respond to this email directly.)
