  Iâ€™m reaching out because your Keygen account "#{@account.slug}" has exceeded your tier's active
  licensed user limit of #{number_with_delimiter @report.license_limit}. Your account currently
  has #{number_with_delimiter @report.license_count} active licensed users. An "active licensed user"
  is any license that has had activity within the last 90 days.
%p
  If you foresee this growth continuing, I recommend that you upgrade from "#{@plan.name}"
  to the next appropriate tier. You can upgrade your tier here: #{link_to 'https://app.keygen.sh/subscription', 'https://app.keygen.sh/subscription'}.

  Let me know if you have any questions about this! (You can respond to this email directly.)
