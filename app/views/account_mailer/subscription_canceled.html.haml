  Thanks for giving Keygen a try, even if it didn't work out. The subscription for
  your account #{@account.name} has been canceled. Access to your account's API
  endpoints have been disabled until your subscription is renewed.

  If you don't mind, would you let me know why you decided not to move forward with
  us? We're a small business and knowing this would really help us out! ðŸ™‚

  If you would like to reactivate your account's subscription, please head over to
  #{link_to "your billing dashboard", "https://app.keygen.sh/billing"}, add a payment
  method, and then reselect a plan.
