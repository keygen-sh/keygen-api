        I noticed that you created a Keygen account but there hasn't been much API activity on it lately. Is there anything I can do to help get things kickstarted?

        Just want to make sure you aren't stuck on anything. As a technical founder, it's easy for me to overlook roadblocks for new users. :)

        Just wanted to let you know that your free trial ends in 2 days. I also noticed that you don't have a payment method added yet. Is there anything I can do to help get one added?

        Hopefully you're getting some value out of Keygen and aren't stuck on anything? You can reply to this email directly with any feedback or questions.

        I'd be more than happy to extend your trial an extra 30 days if you're still in the dev phase -- just let me know.

        I know you're still early in your licensing journey, but I'd love to hear your first impression while your thoughts are fresh.

        What do you think the most valuable features are so far? Is there anything missing?

        Also, please let me know if there's anything you're looking for but canâ€™t find or if you're experiencing any technical issues.
