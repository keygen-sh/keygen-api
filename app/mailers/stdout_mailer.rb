        A lot has happened in 2021, so this zeroth issue of "Stdout" (what I'll be calling this) may be
        a little bit lengthier than future issues. There are a lot of other, smaller, changes that have
        happened, but for those you can check out Keygen's changelog.

        To kick things off, let's talk software distribution --

        ## Keygen Dist v2

        A few months back, we rolled out a brand new version of our distribution API. We made the decision
        to build a better version from the ground up -- one that is fully integrated into our flagship
        software licensing API. This has been a huge goal of mine, really, since I first wrote the Go
        prototype for the first distribution API.

        Some of the rad features for Dist v2:

          - You can add entitlement constraints to releases, ensuring that only users that possess a license
            with those entitlements can access the release. E.g. a popular use case is locking a license to
            a specific major version of a product until they purchase an upgrade. This can be accomplished
            using entitlement constraints, with a V1 and V2 entitlement, respectively.

          - You can set a product's "distribution strategy", allowing you to either distribute your product
            releases OPENly to anybody, no license required, or only to LICENSED users (the default). This
            really opens up doors for Keygen to support a wider variety of business models, such as freemium
            distribution as well as open source (like our CLI, which I'll touch on in a sec).

          - Since the new distribution API is fully integrated into our licensing API, scoping releases
            per-license and per-user is now possible. When authenticated as a licensee, they only see
            the product releases they have a license for.

        We've deprecated our older distribution API, dist.keygen.sh. It'll continue to be available, but we
        recommend using our new API for all new product development.

        The new API is now available at api.keygen.sh.

        Docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/api/releases/

        ## Go SDK

        With the launch of our new distribution API, I really wanted to start focusing on SDKs. We recently
        rolled out our first SDK, for Go. With it, you can add license validation, activation, and automatic
        upgrades to any Go application. It's super slick.

        We're currently working on other SDKs as well, for Node, Swift, and C#. Up next will be a macOS SDK,
        written in Swift. Let me know if you have any specific requests for an SDK!

        Source: https://github.com/keygen-sh/keygen-go
        Docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/api/auto-updates/#auto-updates-go

        Next up, let's talk command line --

        ## Keygen CLI

        We just recently rolled out the beta for our new Keygen CLI. You can use it to sign and publish new
        software releases to the new aforementioned distribution API. Keygen's CLI itself is published
        using the CLI, and it utilizes our Go SDK for automatic upgrades, all backed by Keygen's new
        distribution API (it's dogfooding all the way down!)

        The Keygen CLI is easy to integrate into your normal build and release workflow, complete with support
        for CI/CD environments. Securely sign releases using an Ed25519 private key, and verify upgrades
        using a public key. You can generate a key pair with the CLI's genkey command.

        To install the CLI and try it out, run this "quick install" script:

            curl -sSL https://get.keygen.sh/keygen/cli/install.sh | sh

        The install script will auto-detect your platform and install the appropriate binary. You can, of
        course, install manually by visiting the docs, linked below.

        Source: https://github.com/keygen-sh/keygen-cli
        Docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/cli/

        ## Electron Builder

        We've teamed up with the electron-builder maintainers to craft a super slick integration, allowing
        you to easily provide automatic upgrades, served by the new distribution API, with only a few lines
        of code. (Publishing releases is just as easy -- electron-builder does all the work.)

            const { autoUpdater } = require('electron-updater')

            // Pass in an API token that belongs to the licensee (i.e. a user or
            // activation token)
            autoUpdater.addAuthHeader(`Bearer ${token}`)

            // Check for updates
            autoUpdater.checkForUpdatesAndNotify()

        I'm super stoked about this one. It's something I've been wanting to do since I first created Keygen,
        at a time where licensing APIs weren't even a thing. I hope this makes licensing and distributing
        an Electron app just a little bit easier!

        Well, that's it for this first issue of Stdout. Let me know if you have any feedback for me. We're
        going to make 2022 a great year -- complete with a brand new, much needed, UI overhaul (including
        a highly-requested *customer-facing* portal!)

        Thank you so much for your support!

        Until next time.

        We heard you loud and clear! Activation tokens were not the most convenient authentication mechanism in the world. They had to be created after a license was created, which required multiple API requests, and figuring out which values to send to an end-user was kind of a headache. Should you send the license key? The activation token? Both? (Typically, the answer was both -- which kind of sucked.)

        Starting today, you can configure your policies to have a license key authentication strategy. Doing so will allow you to authenticate with our API using a license key. Simply adjust your policy's authentication strategy to LICENSE, and start passing a license key into any API request's Authorization header using a new License scheme:

          Authorization: License C1B6DE-39A6E3-DE1529-8559A0-4AF593-V3

        It's that simple! No activation token required!

        Instead of figuring out which values to send to your end-users during fulfillment — all you have to do is send them a license key. No other values required! You can then perform any API request that you could do with an activation token, like activate a machine, download a release upgrade, or send a heartbeat ping.

        You can, of course, continue to use activation tokens! Nothing has changed there. And pretty soon, you'll be able to adjust permissions on a per-token basis. So activation tokens will still have a place — where more fine-grained access control is needed. But for the majority of use cases, switching to license key authentication will likely simplify your integration and fulfillment, as well as your software's end-user experience, which we think is a win-win.

        Note on backwards compatibility: for existing policies, and any new policies — nothing has changed. This is an opt-in feature only. Policies will default to using a TOKEN authentication strategy, which behaves exactly like it did before we introduced this new authentication scheme.

        If you'd like to opt-in, switch your policy's authentication strategy to LICENSE. (You can even accept both types of authentication, using MIXED, which should help during migration.)

        Lots has happened this year! It's actually shaping up to be one of our most productive years yet, and we're just getting started.

        So what's new in Keygen? Let's dig in and find out.

        ## License files

        Since 2016, our process for licensing offline devices has evolved quite a few times. First, we didn't do much for offline licensing. (Very much to our customer's dismay.)

        Then, we added the ability to sign and encrypt license keys. This was a hit! Now customers were able to transfer data to offline devices and cryptographically verify the integrity of their license keys.

        Then, we added the ability to generate activation "proofs." These allowed a customer to cryptographically sign a proof of activation for a device, typically activated elsewhere on behalf of the offline device.

        But although those have worked great, the embedded datasets are immutable. We wanted something easier, something more standardized, and something that was able to provide the same up-to-date datasets that our API can provide, but to offline and air-gapped environments.

        Enter, license files --

        Starting today, you can "check-out" a license or machine resource, using their check-out action, and in return, we'll send you a cryptographically signed "certificate" that looks something like this:

          -----BEGIN LICENSE FILE-----
          eyJlbmMiOiJsSTc4N0QwcGZua1RvRDVOSjFpRXlaU093Q09QQ0NOdktKZHpC
          MlpSYlZBQzVsQUhjdzJSUi8xTEhrcXc0ZG5rUEl3TFVYRzhmUzk1R0JWTmtz
          d2JDTmllWm1uOElHeGpkbUY2T1RmNjRzOHlpbFRpL3FlUzJSTlhBdGJBWjUw
          ...
          QWtpVnBudmFWTFhVdkY1UGJJYjNFRXA0YlZNOU1xWjBhNjhQa1R1MW5VS0E0
          TlJWWGp6Ym5DRkF6V3lOU3NUeG9xZm9MV2FlWlhITEZnR21Ub2VBdz09Iiwi
          YWxnIjoiYWVzLTI1Ni1nY20rZWQyNTUxOSJ9
          -----END LICENSE FILE-----

        License file certificates can be decoded (and decrypted), giving you an up-to-date "snapshot" of a machine, a license, and even their entitlement data. They have a digitally signed expiration so you can know exactly when your customer's next check-out should be.

        License file certificates can be saved with a `.lic` file extension and can be distributed to offline or air-gapped devices using email, USB flash drive, license dongle, or any other means (like QR codes!)

        License files work great alongside signed license keys. And we believe they're a great replacement for machine proofs, so please check them out if you're utilizing proofs.

        Check out the docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/api/licenses/#licenses-actions-check-out

        ## Zapier

        Our Zapier integration has officially moved out of beta! Thanks for all the feedback over the last couple months. We're super stoked to partner with Zapier here, and we're already seeing some really cool and creative ways of using Keygen with Zapier.

        If you're looking for a no-code solution for integrating Keygen with other third-party services, such as ChargeBee or Stripe, or even SalesForce, maybe give Zapier a peek.

        More info here: https://keygen.sh/integrate/zapier/

        ## Custom domains

        A few months ago we "officially" rolled out custom domains. It had been available for awhile, but we just didn't really advertise it much outside of our Ent tiers unless customers asked. Now available to purchase for all tiers, custom domains let you set up Keygen behind your own domain name using a CNAME DNS record. The add-on is super easy to set up, and allows your team to completely whitelabel our API behind your own domain.

        If you want to get set up with a custom domain, reply back and we can chat. Pricing starts at $995/yr/domain.

        More info here: https://keygen.sh/docs/custom-domains/

        ## Groups (about time!)

        It's been a *long* time coming, but it's finally here -- Groups!

        User, license and machine resources can be added into Groups, allowing you to natively set up a "team" or company structure to more easily offer licensing options to larger groups. In addition, groups can have limits on the number of each resource allowed in the group.

        For example, you could create a group that allows up to 5 users, 5 licenses and 10 total machines. These group rules would be enforced collectively for all licenses in addition to each license's individual ruleset.

        In the future, we'll be expanding upon the Group resource to add Owners, paving the way for self-management options of Groups.

        Docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/api/groups/

        ## Dead or alive?

        We've added quite a few nifty features to our machine heartbeat system. You can now configure how dead machines are culled, whether or not dead machines can be resurrected, and finally, we added the ability to enforce heartbeats monitors on all licenses.

        These changes add a lot of additional depth to our heartbeat system, overall making the system a lot more flexible, especially when licensing virtual and cloud environments.

        We can't wait to see what people build with these.

        ## User-locked licensing

        We've made a few small but significant changes to our User model that should make implementing a user-locked licensing model much more straightforward.

        1. We removed the requirement for a user to have a password. Now, a user simply needs an email address. (We call these passwordless users.)

        2. We added the ability to scope license validations to a specific user, by email address.

        3. We added the ability to ban a user -- very similar to suspending a license.

        All of these combined make the typical user-locked licensing flow of prompting for an email address and license key super easy -- you send both of those values to our API during a license validation request, and we assert that the license is valid and owned by a user with that email.

        We're hoping this really smooths out our offering for user-locked licensing.

        Docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/choosing-a-licensing-model/user-locked-licenses/

        ## Template variables

        Last but not least --

        We've added support for template variables in signed license keys. Previously, creating a signed license key that contained the license's "expiry" required you to manually calculate the expiry, and then set it in the license's signed dataset, in addition to the license's expiry attribute during creation. Well, we heard your cries and we've simplified things. Moving forward, you can use the `{{expiry}}` template variable for this. It's precalculated by us, and guaranteed to match the license's value at time of creation.

        There are other variables as well, for example `{{id}}` and `{{created}}`. As needs arise, we'll continue to expand upon the available template variables for signed keys.

        We hope this simplifies crafting signed key datasets.

        Docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/api/cryptography/#cryptographic-keys-template-vars

        --

        That's it for the third installment of Stdout. We're looking forward to what's coming up. Let me know if you have any feedback for me -- would love to hear it.

        (And yes -- the new UI is coming! Soon. Lots of behind-the-scenes API work has been happening, like all of the above, to accommodate the new UI's features.)

        Until next time.

        Zeke here with another quick Keygen update. The last couple months has been chock full of behind-the-scenes work, but some of that work is starting to surface through new features.

        To kick things off, let's cover some of the new features for our enterprise Ent tiers.

        ## Permissions

        Historically, Keygen has implemented a role-based strategy with fixed permissions for authorization, and it has worked quite well. But many enterprises have been asking for more fine-grained control around permissions. For example, they may want to create an admin that can only manage a subset of resources, or a read only user, or they want to create a license that can only validate and activate itself -- nothing more.

        Until now, this wasn't possible. But we after months of hard work, we've finally rolled out a powerful permission system that makes all of this, and more, possible.

        The new permission system is only available on our Ent tiers. Standard tiers will continue to function as they always have.

        Please head on over to the blog and the docs to dig in further:

        Blog: https://keygen.sh/blog/announcing-advanced-roles-and-permissions/

        Docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/api/authorization/

        ## Static IPs

        Historically, we've been unable to support static IPs due to a limitation of one of our infrastructure providers. But we know that whitelisting a domain name can be a hard sell for some customers, or it may even be *impossible* depending on the way a customer's private network is configured, complicating an integration.

        To make our offering even better and allow it to be used in even more environments, we've started rolling out static IP addresses for those on the Ent tier. Huge thanks to https://www.quotaguard.com/ for helping us out here.

        If you're interested, please let us know and we'll get you set up. This feature is only available on our Ent tiers.

        Docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/static-ips/

        --

        Next, we'll cover new features and the like that are available on all Std and Ent tiers --

        ## Processes

        As our product grows, we continue to encounter new and novel ways in which our customers utilize our API to their license software products. Sometimes our API supports these novel scenarios, but other times it doesnt, and we take notes and start brainstorming a solution.

        One area in which our API lacked was managing application instances on a per-machine basis. Essentially, we want to be able to limit the number of machines per-license, as well as the number of instances per-machine.

        Our API supported the former and has since day 1 -- limiting the number of machines per-license -- but not the number of instances per-machine.

        Well, we finally have an answer to the latter problem: Processes.

        Processes allow you to limit the number of PIDs per-machine, very similarly to how a machine limits the number of devices per-license.

        We hope this is yet another step towards making our API the #1 choice for licensing software.

        Docs: https://keygen.sh/docs/api/processes/

        ## API Versioning

        If you're one of those that peek our changelog from time to time, you may have noticed that we've made some breaking changes recently.

        But if you don't peek our changelog, you may not have noticed these breaking changes at all.

        Wait... what?

        You heard that right! We've made some rather large breaking changes to our API and you probably didn't even notice (and it'd be a major bug if you did!)

        That may seem like a stark contradiction, but we've spent a considerable amount of time recently on our API versioning strategy. We even wrote a blog post about it, and open sourced how we do it!

        Please check out the post (and gem) if you're interested in API versioning. And peek our changelog if you're curious about the recent changes.

        ## New SDK

        Our Go SDK has a new major version available. This release coincides with the breaking changes mentioned above. Be sure to check it out if you're a Gopher.

        In related news -- we're currently working on a Rust SDK. We're hoping to have a slick integration with Tauri as well.

        Please let us know what languages you're hoping for next!

        ## New CLI

        Our CLI also has a new major version available. The CLI has been completely reworked to coincide with the changes made to our distribution API.

        That's all for now. I appreciate your continued support. Lots in store for the future, including a rather big surprise that ryhmes with "ocean horse."

        Until next time.

        Zeke here with a pretty big update -- Keygen is now open source!

        As some of you may already know, this has been in the works for nearly a year. I'm incredibly excited for this change, and I hope you will be too.

        So, what does this mean for you and for Keygen?

        ## What's changing

        If you're a current Keygen Cloud customer (what we're calling our SaaS moving forward), nothing changes. Starting today, in addition to Keygen Cloud, Keygen is now available in two self-hosted editions: Keygen CE and Keygen EE.

        Each edition offers unique features and benefits, and you can choose the edition that best suits your specific needs:

        - Keygen CE: the Community Edition (CE) of Keygen. This is a self-hosted single-tenant version of Keygen's API. To start using Keygen CE, you can visit our GitHub or follow our self-hosting instructions. Keygen CE is free (as in beer) to self-host.

        - Keygen EE: the Enterprise Edition (EE) of Keygen. Also a self-hosted version of Keygen's API, Keygen EE can be single- or multi-tenant depending on configuration and license. Keygen EE comes with features that are more enterprise-centric such as environments, request logs, event (audit) logs, and advanced permissions. Keygen EE will require a valid license key to self-host.

        - Keygen Cloud: the SaaS version of Keygen. Keygen Cloud is a fully-managed cloud service that provides all the benefits of Keygen EE without the need to manage infrastructure. This is the Keygen you already know and love.

        ## Why open source?

        Well, a lot of reasons. So many that I wrote a blog post about the why:

          https://keygen.sh/blog/all-your-licensing-are-belong-to-you/

        Please give it a read. Links to code and docs are there too.

        ## What next?

        If you're interested in Keygen EE, reply to this email directly or reach out to sales@keygen.sh anytime to start a conversation.

        For self-hosting Keygen, check out the new self-hosting docs:
