Feature: Analytics of top IPs by volume

  Background:
    Given the following "accounts" exist:
      | Name    | Slug  |
      | Test 1  | test1 |
      | Test 2  | test2 |
    And I send and accept JSON

  Scenario: Endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a GET request to "/accounts/test1/analytics/actions/top-ips-by-volume"
    Then the response status should be "403"
    And sidekiq should have 0 "request-log" jobs

  Scenario: Admin retrieves analytics of top IPs by volume for their account
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 50 "request-logs"
    And "request-logs" 1-15 have the following attributes:
      """
      {
        "ip": "192.168.1.1"
      }
      """
    And "request-logs" 16-30 have the following attributes:
      """
      {
        "ip": "192.168.0.1"
      }
      """
    And "request-logs" 31-50 have the following attributes:
      """
      {
        "ip": "2600:1700:3e90:a450:42d:239d:bf8d:2078"
      }
      """
    And "request-logs" 11-25 have the following attributes:
      """
      {
        "createdAt": "$time.1.year.ago"
      }
      """
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a GET request to "/accounts/test1/analytics/actions/top-ips-by-volume"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the JSON response should contain meta with the following:
      """
      [
        {
          "ip": "2600:1700:3e90:a450:42d:239d:bf8d:2078",
