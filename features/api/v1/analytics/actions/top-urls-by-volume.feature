Feature: Analytics of top URLs by volume

  Background:
    Given the following "accounts" exist:
      | Name    | Slug  |
      | Test 1  | test1 |
      | Test 2  | test2 |
    And I send and accept JSON

  Scenario: Endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a GET request to "/accounts/test1/analytics/actions/top-urls-by-volume"
    Then the response status should be "403"
    And sidekiq should have 0 "request-log" jobs

  Scenario: Admin retrieves analytics of top URLs by volume for their account
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 100 "request-logs"
    And "request-logs" 1-50 have the following attributes:
