Feature: Analytic counts

  Background:
    Given the following "accounts" exist:
      | Name    | Slug  |
      | Test 1  | test1 |
      | Test 2  | test2 |
    And I send and accept JSON

  Scenario: Endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a GET request to "/accounts/test1/analytics/actions/count"
    Then the response status should be "403"
    And sidekiq should have 0 "request-log" jobs

  Scenario: Admin retrieves analytic counts for their account
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 50 "users"
    And the current account has 50 userless "licenses"
    And the current account has 30 "machines" for existing "licenses"
    # Adjust associations so that some users own multiple liceness
    And "licenses" 0-10 have the following attributes:
      """
      {
        "userId": "$users[2]"
      }
      """
    And "license" 42 has the following attributes:
      """
      {
        "userId": "$users[42]"
      }
      """
    # Adjust validation timestamps so that some old licenses are still active
    And "licenses" 0-20 have the following attributes:
      """
      {
        "lastValidatedAt": "$time.1.day.ago"
      }
      """
    # Adjust created timestamps so that some licenses are old
    And "licenses" 0-25 have the following attributes:
      """
      {
        "createdAt": "$time.1.year.ago"
      }
      """
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a GET request to "/accounts/test1/analytics/actions/count"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    # 50 users + 50 active unassigned licenses = 50 ALU
    # 50 ALU - 25 inactive/old unassigned licenses = 25 ALU
    # 25 ALU + 20 active/old unassigned licenses = 45 ACU
    # 45 ALU - 10 licenses assigned to user #2 = 36 ALU
    # 36 ALU - 1 license assigned to user #42 = 36 ALU
    And the JSON response should contain meta with the following:
      """
      {
        "activeLicensedUsers": 36,
        "activeLicenses": 45,
        "totalLicenses": 50,
