Feature: Machine proof actions

  Background:
    Given the following "accounts" exist:
      | Name    | Slug  |
      | Test 1  | test1 |
      | Test 2  | test2 |
    And I send and accept JSON

  Scenario: Endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 1 "machine"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a POST request to "/accounts/test1/machines/$0/actions/generate-offline-proof"
    Then the response status should be "403"

  Scenario: Admin generates a proof for a machine with the default dataset
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 3 "machines"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a POST request to "/accounts/test1/machines/$0/actions/generate-offline-proof"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the JSON response should be meta that contains a valid activation proof of the following dataset:
      """
      {
        "aid": "$machines[0].account.id",
        "pid": "$machines[0].policy.id",
        "lid": "$machines[0].license.id",
        "mid": "$machines[0].id",
        "key": "$machines[0].license.key",
        "exp": "$machines[0].license.expiry",
        "crt": "$machines[0].created_at",
        "frp": "$machines[0].fingerprint"
      }
      """
    And the response should contain a valid signature header for "test1"

  Scenario: Admin generates a proof for a machine with a custom dataset
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 3 "machines"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a POST request to "/accounts/test1/machines/$0/actions/generate-offline-proof" with the following:
      """
      {
        "meta": {
          "proof": {
            "fingerprint": "$machines[0].fingerprint",
            "id": "$machines[0].id",
            "nonce": 1
          }
        }
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the JSON response should be meta that contains a valid activation proof of the following dataset:
      """
      {
        "fingerprint": "$machines[0].fingerprint",
        "id": "$machines[0].id",
        "nonce": 1
      }
      """
    And the response should contain a valid signature header for "test1"

  Scenario: License attempts to generate a proof for their machine
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 2 "licenses"
    And the current account has 2 "machines"
    And all "machines" have the following attributes:
      """
      { "licenseId": "$licenses[1]" }
      """
    And I am a license of account "test1"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a POST request to "/accounts/test1/machines/$0/actions/generate-offline-proof"
    Then the response status should be "403"
