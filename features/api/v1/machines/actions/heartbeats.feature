Feature: Machine heartbeat actions

  Background:
    Given the following "accounts" exist:
      | Name    | Slug  |
      | Test 1  | test1 |
      | Test 2  | test2 |
    And I send and accept JSON

  Scenario: Ping endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 1 "machines"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a POST request to "/accounts/test1/machines/$0/actions/ping-heartbeat"
    Then the response status should be "403"

  Scenario: Reset endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 1 "machines"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a POST request to "/accounts/test1/machines/$0/actions/reset-heartbeat"
    Then the response status should be "403"
