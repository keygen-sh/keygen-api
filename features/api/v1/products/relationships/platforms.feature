Feature: Product platforms relationship

  Background:
    Given the following "accounts" exist:
      | Name    | Slug  |
      | Test 1  | test1 |
      | Test 2  | test2 |
    And I send and accept JSON

  Scenario: Endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled
    Given I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 1 "product"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a GET request to "/accounts/test1/products/$0/platforms"
    Then the response status should be "403"

  Scenario: Admin retrieves the platforms for a product
    Given the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has the following "product" rows:
      | id                                   | name   |

      | 54a44eaf-6a83-4bb4-b3c1-17600dfdd77c | Test 2 |
    And the current account has the following "release" rows:
