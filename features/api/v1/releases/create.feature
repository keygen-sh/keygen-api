Feature: Create release

  Background:
    Given the following "accounts" exist:
      | name    | slug  |
      | Test 1  | test1 |
      | Test 2  | test2 |
    And I send and accept JSON

  Scenario: Endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled
    And I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a POST request to "/accounts/test1/releases"
    Then the response status should be "403"

  Scenario: Admin creates a new release for their account
    Given the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 2 "webhook-endpoints"
    And the current account has 1 "product"
    And the current account has 14 "releases"
    And I am an admin of account "test1"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a POST request to "/accounts/test1/releases" with the following:
