    Then the response status should be "303"

  Scenario: Admin attempts to retrieve an artifact for another account
    Given I am an admin of account "test2"
    But the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 3 "releases"
    And the current account has 1 "artifact" for each "release"
    And I use an authentication token
    When I send a GET request to "/accounts/test1/artifacts/$0"
    Then the response status should be "401"
    And the JSON response should be an array of 1 error
