@api/v1.0 @deprecated
Feature: Show release artifact

  Background:
    Given the following "accounts" exist:
      | name    | slug  |
      | Test 1  | test1 |
      | Test 2  | test2 |
    And I send and accept JSON

  Scenario: Endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled
    And I am an admin of account "test1"
    And the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has 1 "release"
    And the current account has 1 "artifact" for the last "release"
    And I use an authentication token
    And I use API version "1.0"
    When I send a GET request to "/accounts/test1/artifacts/$0"
    Then the response status should be "403"

  # NOTE(ezekg) Since we no longer have a uniqueness index, and we've removed the upsert
  #             release method, we need to assert that multiple artifacts with the same
  #             version are correctly handled, i.e. that the latest version is fetched,
  #             sorted by created_at and semver_* columns.
  Scenario: License retrieves the latest artifact by filename (duplicate versions)
    Given the current account is "test1"
    And the current account has the following "product" rows:
      | id                                   | name     |
      | 6198261a-48b5-4445-a045-9fed4afc7735 | Test App |
    And the current account has the following "release" rows:
      | id                                   | product_id                           | version | channel | api_version |
