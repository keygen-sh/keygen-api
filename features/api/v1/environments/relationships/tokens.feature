Feature: Generate authentication token for environment
  Background:
    Given the following "plan" rows exist:
      | id                                   | name       |
      | 9b96c003-85fa-40e8-a9ed-580491cd5d79 | Standard 1 |
      | 44c7918c-80ab-4a13-a831-a2c46cda85c6 | Ent 1      |
    Given the following "account" rows exist:
      | name   | slug  | plan_id                              |
