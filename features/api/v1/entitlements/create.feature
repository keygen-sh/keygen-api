Feature: Create entitlements

  Background:
    Given the following "accounts" exist:
      | Name    | Slug  |
      | Test 1  | test1 |
      | Test 2  | test2 |
    And I send and accept JSON

  Scenario: Endpoint should be inaccessible when account is disabled
    Given the account "test1" is canceled

    And I use an authentication token
    And the current account has 1 "webhook-endpoint"
    When I send a POST request to "/accounts/test1/entitlements" with the following:
