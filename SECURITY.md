# Security Policy

Contact: security@keygen.sh

At Keygen, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But
no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can
still be vulnerabilities present.

## Supported Versions

We only add security updates to the latest `MAJOR.MINOR` version of the
project. No security updates are backported to previous versions. If
you want be up to date on security patches, make sure your Keygen
image is up to date.

## Reporting

If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we
can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like
to ask you to help us better protect our customers, our users,
and our systems by disclosing responsibly.

At this time we do not have a bug-bounty program in place, but would
like one in the future.
